                <h2>My topics</h2>
                <p>Music is one of my favorite hobbies as I can listen to music and do other things or use it to focus, it also helps to pass the time. I like listening to any kind of music as I don't really have a specific type of music that I can call my favorite.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Video games is one of my main hobbies as I enjoy the story of certain games or family games like party or racing games. My favorite genere of games is platforming, adventure, and multiplayer but I like other genere of games.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Having pets can help, it can be a dog, a cat or any other kind of pet. Pets can learn tricks like rolling over, playing fetch and many other kinds of tricks, it's different for every animal. </p>
